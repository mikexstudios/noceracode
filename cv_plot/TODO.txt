Things to add:

1. Output third column containing segment number, this can help shading the plot
   in R to see progression of the CV.

2. Ability to combine multiple CVs into one CSV file with a third column writing
   the CV number. This can help plot multiple CVs...
   => Well, easier to just do this manually.
