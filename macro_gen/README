Ideal macro generation system
=============================

1. ./[name of specific generator] (just run it)
2. Edit the generator file for specifics.


Notes on .mcr generation
========================

1. Use windows-style line endings: \0d\0a is \r\n
2. The first 4 bytes are a unsigned 32-bit integeter in little endian format
   specifying the total number of subsequent bytes to read.
   ex. blank file -> 0x00000000
       'A'        -> 0x01000000
       3200 bytes -> 0x800C0000  (which is 0x0C80 -> 3200 bytes in hex)
   Use ruby's Array(3200).pack('V') (where V denotes little-endian) to generate
   the correct hex output.
